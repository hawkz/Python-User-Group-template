Python User Group template
==========================

After getting tired too tired and then going to PyWM.. Steve made the silly suggestion
that we could develop a new site in an hour. This repo is what was produced. The brief:

* Have some intro text
* Show when then next event is
* Link to the mailing list
* Have a mechanism for recording what happened at each event
* Design to be related to PyWM

<http://pywm.eu/>


Overview
--------

The template is based on the goldilocks approach, with a single type measure being the 
just right width, and then a media query for smaller or larger displays. The background 
colour can be reversed (maybe should add something do flip it) and the font colours 
should still work. I've tried to keep everything as lean as possible, and resolution 
independant (except for images)

Why?
----

I like PyWM, I like designing sites, I like silly deadline challengesâ€¦


Usage
-----

If you want to use this for something else then awesome! Let me know to boost my ego and
encourage updates and tweaks :)
